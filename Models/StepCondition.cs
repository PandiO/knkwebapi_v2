    /// 1. START CONDITION: Determines if the user can navigate to this step.
    ///    Example: "User Agreement" step requires "Age Verification" step to be completed.
    /// 2. COMPLETION CONDITION: Determines if the user can proceed to the next step.
    ///    Example: "Payment" step requires "Total Amount > 0" before allowing "Next".
    /// 
    /// USE CASES:
    /// - Skip optional steps based on previous inputs (e.g., skip "Shipping Address" for digital products).
    /// - Enforce prerequisites (e.g., must complete "Basic Info" before accessing "Advanced Settings").
    /// - Block progression until external validation passes (e.g., "Email Verification" step).
